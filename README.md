# Modular Synth Schematics
Schematics ready to make PCBs for DIY modular synthesis. 

List of what I've gone through so far and what they're based off of.
Most of the projects here are based off of schematics I've found but
the PCB layouts are my own. Feel free to use them for non-commercial applications.
