# Modular Synth Schematics
Schematics ready to make PCBs for DIY modular synthesis. 

List of what I've gone through so far and what they're based off of.
Most of the projects here are based off of schematics I've found or data sheets but
the PCB layouts are my own. Feel free to use them for non-commercial applications.

Schematic and PCB file generated using [KiCad](https://kicad.org/)

STLs for panel stencils created using [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)

Modules are made in the [Kosmo](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/modular) format unless otherwise noted.
